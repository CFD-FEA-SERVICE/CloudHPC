# APIKEY

One of the main feature of cloudHPC is its integrability with third part software. This is made possible thanks to your own APIKEY, an unique identifier which allows you to interact with the cloudHPC environment using API calls.

Every account is assigned a specific APIKEY once it is generated. Using this APIKEY with third part software is mandatory in order to correctly link your account to the software you are using.

!!! note
    The use of the API might not be available if you are under the FREE plan (i.e. using the initial 300 vCPU Hours).

## Retrieving your APIKEY
Your APIKEY is reported into your profile page. To access it just click on "profile" under the "account" menu as in the following image:

Once you enter your account details, your APIKEY is the string you find inside the appropriate box.

!!! danger
    Store your APIKEY safely and, in case of doubt, get in contact with us at info@cfdfeaservice.it . Sharing your APIKEY with unknown people means giving full access to your account to these people and, consequently, sharing with them your simulations, results and allowing them to use your own account.
