# Account

A new cloudHPC account can be generated using the account [request form](https://cloudhpc.cloud/form-request/). The account is not generated authomatically to any registering users, but there is a manual procedure to verify the info collected during the account generation. Our support can generally decide either for a direct account activation or to proceed with a request of clarification to the user who is willing to generate a new account. The approval process generally takes few minutes, but our support department is operative only during office hour based on Rome Time Zone (CET/CEST) and, as a consequence, during off office hours or during bank holidays the account approval process can be longer than expected.

Once your account is activated, the system sends an email like the following one. The emails provide the credentials to access the platform.

## Account safety
Every account has two level of security. The above credentials are in fact not sufficient to access your account as you will be asked of a further proof of identification. This security levels guarantee a complete control over access to your cloudHPC account.
The first safety level is based on a password provided by the system once the account is generated. It is possible to modify it, but any password must follow precise rules:

!!! note
    _Minimum 7 characters lowercase (a-z), uppercase (A-Z), numbers (0-9) and special (.*#@!â€¦). Spaces are not allowed._

</p>

### Base safety level [OTP - One Time Password]
The base safety level requires an OTP - one time password - to be entered after the credentials provided by the registration confirmation email. After you loging with your credentials (username and password) a secondary password is required.

</p>

This code is a temporary password generated by the system and sent to your registered email address. You can retrieve this code by checking your email and entering it on the OTP window displayed above. In case you do not receive this email, double check the spam folder or in case get in touch with our support team.

</p>

In case you want to setup or modify the registered email address you can open your profile page and update the details you have in this page.

</p>

!!! note
    In case you share the account with two or more people, it is recommendable to generate a group email address such as _cloudhpc@companyname.com_ where the system sends the notifications and the OTP code to be used by all the users.

The OTP is not required everytime you login into the cloudHPC, but the frequency depends on several paramenters such as:

* time based - upon specific frequency, your account requires you to enter a new OTP
* device based - if you are connecting to your account using a new device then a new OTP is required
* IP based - if you are connecting to your account through a new IP address then a new OTP is required

### Advanced safety level [TFA - Two Factors Authentication]
The most advanced safety level consists of a TFA - Two Factors Authentication. This possibility is optional on every account and requires the use of an authentication app such as:

* [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&pcampaignid=web_share)

* [Microsoft Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&pcampaignid=web_share)

You can enable this option under the **Security** option of your account. A new QRCode appears to scan.

<p align="center">
   <img width="400" src="https://cfdfeaservice.it/wiki/cloud-hpc/images/AbilitaTFA.png">
</p>

Use the your authenticator app to scan the QRCode and then enter the code it appears on the app to confirm the connection.

</p>

Every time you login to the cloudHPC you'll also be required to enter the TFA code generated using the app.

!!! note
    This methodology is safer than the OTP code and it restrict the possibility to share the account among two or more users.

## Password reset
In case you lose your password, it is possible to ask for a password reset. On the [login page](https://cloud.cfdfeaservice.it) click on the password reset button and enter the **email address** registered for your account.

<p align="center">
   <img width="600" src="https://cfdfeaservice.it/wiki/cloud-hpc/images/PasswordReset.png">
</p>

The system will send you an email with a one time link where you can enter a new password. To access your account go back to the login page and enter the new credentials: username and the just generated password.
